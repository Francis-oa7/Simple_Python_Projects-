This is a program that can evaluate the various parameters involved in Heat transfer calculation
The parameters involved are Rate of heat transfer(Q), Area(A), Thermal conductivity(K), Temperature differnce(dt) and Thickness(x).
These parameters can be calculated for the various Types of Heat transfers, that is Conduction, Convection and Radiation.
